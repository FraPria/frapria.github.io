# Math

Math explained starting from basic knowledge. I love the video about the convolutions [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA).
Also the neural network series [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

- [Ask a mathematician, ask a physicist](https://www.askamathematician.com): they answer non trivial questions from their followers. I suggest to read this about the relationship between [thermodynamics entropy and information theory entropy](https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/01/q-whats-the-relationship-between-entropy-in-the-information-theory-sense-and-the-thermodynamics-sense/)
- Primer

# Physics
- Veritasium: well explained physics. If you want to start an existential questioning, I suggest [Parallel Worlds Probably Exist. Hereâ€™s Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTXTPe3wahc)

# Data science and Dataviz
- [The pudding](https://pudding.cool/): a digital publication makes data fun. I suggest the article about the ridiculus size of women's pockes https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/
- [Driven by data](https://driven-by-data.net/)
- [Complexity explorable](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/)
- [Jackie Tran](https://art.jacquietran.com/) generative art blog

# Other science & Technology
- Simone Giertz: super funny shitty robots inventor
- Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell: Great animations and divulgation. I love the video "[What Happens If We Throw an Elephant From a Skyscraper?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0)"
