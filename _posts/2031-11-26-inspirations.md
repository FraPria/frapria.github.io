# Math

Math explained starting from basic knowledge. I love the video about the convolutions [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA).

Also the neural network series [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

- [Ask a mathematician, ask a physicist](https://www.askamathematician.com): they answer non trivial questions from their followers. I suggest to read this about the relationship between [thermodynamics entropy and information theory entropy](https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/01/q-whats-the-relationship-between-entropy-in-the-information-theory-sense-and-the-thermodynamics-sense/)
- Primer

# Physics
- Veritasium: well explained physics. If you want to start an existential questioning, I suggest [Parallel Worlds Probably Exist. Hereâ€™s Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTXTPe3wahc)

# Data science
- Cool data analysis and vizualizations: https://pudding.cool/

# Other science & Technology
- Simone Giertz
- Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell: Great animations and divulgation. I love the video "[What Happens If We Throw an Elephant From a Skyscraper?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0)"
- Matt Henderson
