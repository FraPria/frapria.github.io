# Math

- [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown):
Math explained starting from basic knowledge. <br> I love the video about the convolutions [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA) <br>
Also the neural network series [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

- [Ask a mathematician, ask a physicist](https://www.askamathematician.com): they answer non trivial questions from their followers. I suggest to read this about the relationship between [thermodynamics entropy and information theory entropy](https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/01/q-whats-the-relationship-between-entropy-in-the-information-theory-sense-and-the-thermodynamics-sense/)

- [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/@PrimerBlobs): he develops evolutionary and probability simulations to understand how world works.

- [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile/): a guy interviewing mathematician about paradoxes, riddles and mathematical problems. <br> Check out the [Light switching problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBDRX6bk-A) <br>

- Hannah Fry: a mathematician talking about math in every day life. I suggest the video from Stand-Up math [The Mathematics of Winning Monopoly
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQXz5RBBtU) or her TED talk about [The mathematics of love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVXsjVdvmY)
- [Vsauce 2](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce2/videos): great explainations about probability problems! <br> Check out the [Birthday paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTb57aZHZs) video

# Physics
- Veritasium: well explained physics. If you want to start an existential questioning, I suggest [Parallel Worlds Probably Exist. Hereâ€™s Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTXTPe3wahc)

# Data science and Dataviz
- [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath): he does a great job in explaining data science concept theories using both whiteboard and Jupyter notebooks. I found pretty useful his playlist about [time series analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoJ2OctrFLA&list=PLvcbYUQ5t0UHOLnBzl46_Q6QKtFgfMGc3)
- [The pudding](https://pudding.cool/): a digital publication makes data fun. I suggest the article about the ridiculus size of women's pockes https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/
- [Driven by data](https://driven-by-data.net/)
- [Complexity explorable](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/)
- [Jackie Tran](https://art.jacquietran.com/) generative art blog

# Other science & Technology
- Simone Giertz: super funny shitty robots inventor
- Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell: Great animations and divulgation. I love the video "[What Happens If We Throw an Elephant From a Skyscraper?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0)"
- [Matt Henderson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt5AfwLFPxWKgImYwrKIL3iWwyOu_JeC5):
