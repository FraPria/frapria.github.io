Here I show how to develop a simple interactive app using Streamlit package in Python. The aim of the app is to plot flocks animations with different user-defined parameters. To have a deeper insight on the algorithm used to produce flocks patter, take a look on my previous post on [boids algorithm]({% post_url 2022-09-17-flocks %}).

## Packages
You can install Streamlit easily using [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/streamlit) or with [pip](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation#install-streamlit-on-macoslinux).

In this line I import the _move_ function which is the core of the boids algorithm, explained in the previous post.
```python 
from function import move
```
and then I import all the rest of the packages:
```python
import streamlit as st
import time
import numpy as np
from streamlit.hello.utils import show_code
```

## Lateral bar with parameters

Streamlit code has the core within the function _animation_demo()_ which is composed by 3 main parts, where I:

1. Set up the parameters (both the fixed ones and user-defined).
2. Run the boids algorithm.
3. Plot the image: personally this was the hardest part, because I choose not to use matplot.lib because it was not so quick as I expected, and the birds movements were not so smooth. Therefore I chose to create the animation plotting "pixel by pixel".


### 1. Parameters setup
with sidebar.slider you can create a slider with values ranging from __min_value__ to __max_value__ and with an incremental step of __step__ and the default value is encoded in __value__ parameter.

```python
def animation_demo():
    # %%
    L = 450
    tsteps = 500
    V0 = 20                      # Initial velocity
    
    wall_repulsion = V0          # https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Animal_Movement/Boids-algorithm.html#Screen-edges
                                 # should be similar to max speed, otherwise they escape
    margin = 40
    max_speed = V0

    # %%
    n = st.sidebar.slider("Number of birds", min_value= 2, max_value = 1000, value = 300, step =2)
    
    # Rule 1
    # velocity to center contribution
    R = st.sidebar.slider("1. COHESION", 
                          min_value=0.,  max_value=2., step = 0.05, value = 0.1)
    
    # Rule 2
    bird_repulsion = st.sidebar.slider("2. SEPARATION", 
                                       min_value=0., max_value=10., step = 1., value = 7.)        
    # Rule 3
    match_velocity =  st.sidebar.slider("3. ALIGNMENT", 
                                       min_value=0., max_value=10., step = 0.5, value = 3.)     
    

    # Community distance (~ community size)
    neighbors_dist = st.sidebar.slider("Community distance i.e. distance of influence between birds (From spread to packed). Applied to rule 1 and rule 3)",
                                       min_value = 10, max_value=200, value = 70)

    privacy = st.sidebar.slider("Bird privacy (distance at which we apply rule 2)", 
                                       min_value=0, max_value=30, step = 1, value = 14)
    # low values make more "stains" of birds, nice visualization
    # When they see each other at this distance, 
    # they apply bird repulsion in the other direction

    progress_bar = st.sidebar.progress(0)

    frame_text = st.sidebar.empty()
```
### 2. Run the algorith
In this block we run the algorithm and save the birds position in a (L*2+margin) x (L*2+margin) matrix __N__. L*2+margin is the plot width and height, _margin_ parameter is used to keep the birds at distance from the wall, otherwise they somethime cross the boundaries, rising an error. This matrix is updated at every time step.

### 3. Show animation plot
The matrix N is initially filled with zeros, and then, after running the _move()_ function, each boid position is updated with a 1. This is also used to color the pixel on screen: a value of 1 means white, and a value of 0 means black. 

__Resolution problem:__
In order to have smooth movements I chose the plot to be 940 pixels wide (L*2+margin). But this means that is almost impossible to see a single boid (so a single pixel) moving using an ordinary screen. So I needed to increase the size of the points from 1 pixel to 5 pixels. To do so I shifted and added up the matrix to 1 pixel to the right, left, up, down. The boids was then no more represented by a single pixel, but 5 pixels forming a cross.
This was enough to improve the visibility of the boids.


```python

    image = st.empty()
    
    # %% INITIALIZE
    x = np.zeros((n,tsteps))
    y = np.zeros((n,tsteps))
    
    x[:,0] = np.random.uniform(low=-L, high=L, size=(int(n),))
    y[:,0] = np.random.uniform(low=-L, high=L, size=(int(n),))
    
    x[:,1] = x[:,0] + np.random.uniform(low=-V0, high=V0, size=(int(n),))
    y[:,1] = y[:,0] + np.random.uniform(low=-V0, high=V0, size=(int(n),))
    
    
    y = y.astype(int)
    x = x.astype(int)
    
    # %% MOVE
    N = np.zeros((L*2+margin, L*2+margin))
    last_col = np.shape(N)[0]-1
    for t in range(1,tsteps-1):
        x[:, t+1],y[:, t+1] = move(x[:, t],y[:, t], x[:,t-1],y[:,t-1],
                                   n, neighbors_dist, R, privacy, bird_repulsion, match_velocity, L, margin, wall_repulsion, max_speed)
        
        y = y.astype(int)
        x = x.astype(int)
        N = np.zeros((L*2+margin, L*2+margin))
        # N[y[:,t]+L+10, x[:,t]+L+10] = 0
        N[y[:,t+1]+L+round(margin/2), x[:,t+1]+L+round(margin/2)] = 1
        
        # Increase the size of the points
        to_plot = N
        to_plot[1:last_col,:] = N[1:last_col,:] + N[0:(last_col-1),:] # right shift of the matrix
        to_plot[:,1:last_col] = N[:,1:last_col] + N[:,0:(last_col-1)] # upper shift of the matrix
        to_plot[0:(last_col-1),:] = N[0:(last_col-1),:] + N[1:last_col,:] # left shift of the matrix
        to_plot[:,0:(last_col-1)] = N[:,0:(last_col-1)] + N[:,1:last_col]  # bottom shift of the matrix
        to_plot = np.ceil(to_plot/np.amax(to_plot))

        image.image(to_plot, use_column_width=True)
        time.sleep(0.05)

    # We clear elements by calling empty on them.
    progress_bar.empty()
    frame_text.empty()

    # Streamlit widgets automatically run the script from top to bottom. Since
    # this button is not connected to any other logic, it just causes a plain
    # rerun.
    st.button("Re-run")
```

Finally you can write a title and a markdown description of the code and run the animation calling the function _animation_demo()_ 

```python
st.set_page_config(page_title="Flocks", page_icon="üê§") #  üìπ
st.markdown("# Flock Animation")
st.sidebar.header("Parameters")
st.markdown(
    """The animation shows a simulation of a flock of birds. 
Flocks of birds follows three rules simulataneously:
1. __Cohesion__ rule: a bird flies towards the center of mass of the nearest neighbors.
    
2. __Separation__ rule: a bird tries to avoid collisions with other birds.

3. __Alignment__ rule: a bird tries to match velocity with near birds.

You can change the intensity of these rules moving the sliders in the lateral bar.

More details in my github page [https://frapria.github.io/blog/flocks](https://frapria.github.io/blog/flocks)
"""
)

animation_demo()     
show_code(animation_demo)
```

To run the app yopu just need to run this line of code in bash
```bash
streamlit run flock_app.py 
```
and you just need to copy the Local URL that is displayed and paste it in whatever browser you use.

## Deployment
Hehe this is a sore subject!
I have tried to doploy this app on both HuggingFace and Streamlit cloud, but I would require more resources that I am available of. In HuggingFace the app is formally running, but the animation is irregular, unsmooth and crappy. I should buy CPUs to make it work, but for now, I don't see any benefits.
