# Flocks patterns
### By Francesca Priante

    
Play around with the algorigthm using the streamlit app I developed! [TBA] ## LINK

Have you ever wondered how do flock of birds create amazing floating patterns in the sky?
They seem to follow very complicated rules and umpredictable movements, but this kind of system is actually not complicated, just __complex__. 

![false_knees](/assets/images/flocks/00_false_knees.jpeg){:.centered}

The complexity of the flock of birds arises from the interaction of birds responding to simple rules. This type of behavior is called __emergent behavior__ and it's a key feature of self-organized systems. 

The simple rules that model pretty well this behaviour were formalized by Craig Reynolds in 1986 and state like this:
1. __Cohesion__ or flock centering: attempt to stay close to nearby flockmates.
2. __Separation__ or collision avoidance: avoid collision with nearby flockmates.
3. __Alignment__ or velocity matching: attempr to match velocity with nearby flockmates.

The 3 rules make up the __boids-algorithm__, and it does not apply only to birds but also to fish schools. 
"Boids" term comes from the union of birds-oid, which refers to all the birds-like elements.


Let's dive into the algorithm.

## Needed libraries


```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import random
import os
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
import math
```

## Set up parameters


```python
# %% 
# Initialize plot
L = 450
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(xlim=(-L, L), ylim=(-L, L))
points, = ax.plot([], [], '.', color = 'black')
plt.axis('off')


tsteps         = 200        # Time steps
n              = 300        # Number of birds
V0             = 20         # Initial velocity

wall_repulsion = 20         # https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Animal_Movement/Boids-algorithm.html#Screen-edges
margin         = 20
max_speed      = 20
neighbors_dist = 70         # Community distance (At which distance they apply rule 1 and rule 3)

# Rule 1: COHESION
R = 0.1                     # velocity to center contribution

# Rule 2: SEPARATION
bird_repulsion = 7          # low values  make more "stains" of birds, nice visualization
privacy        = 14         #  Avoid each other ,length. When they see each other at this distance, 

# Rule 3: ALIGNMENT
match_velocity = 3    


```    


## Initialize boids
Give boids random position and random velocities (up to V0) at time 0.


```python
x = np.zeros((n,tsteps))
y = np.zeros((n,tsteps))

# Randomize initial positions
x[:,0] = np.random.uniform(low=-L, high=L, size=(int(n),))
y[:,0] = np.random.uniform(low=-L, high=L, size=(int(n),))

# Randomize initial velocity
x[:,1] = x[:,0] + np.random.uniform(low=-V0, high=V0, size=(int(n),))
y[:,1] = y[:,0] + np.random.uniform(low=-V0, high=V0, size=(int(n),))
```

## Three flock rules
### Rule 1. Cohesion
First thing to do is to measure the distance between each pair of boids and check wheter the distance is lower or equal to the *neighbots_dist* that we set at the beginning.
Then, for each boid *i* we compute the mean position of its neighbors (**relative center of mass**). We then define the velocity contribution of this step as the vector between the starting position and the relative center of mass, weighted by the coefficient *R*.

</div>

Note: when computing the distance between each boids, I considered also the self distance of each boid, just for simplicity. So when considering the relative center of mass, the boid *i* position is also taken into account. But it's negligible. You can avoid this by just uncommenting the ```& (m!=0)```.


```python
def moveToCenter(x0, y0, neighbors_dist, n, R):
    m = squareform(pdist(np.transpose([x0,y0])))
    idx = (m<=neighbors_dist) # & (m!=0)
    
    center_x = np.zeros(n)
    center_y = np.zeros(n)
    vx = np.zeros(n)
    vy = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(0, n-1):
        center_x[i] = np.mean(x0[idx[i,]])
        center_y[i] = np.mean(y0[idx[i,]])
        vx[i] = -(x0[i] - center_x[i])*R
        vy[i] = -(y0[i] - center_y[i])*R

    return vx,vy
```

### Rule 2. Separation

Here the pairwise distance between pairs of boids is required to be lower than the *privacy* parameter to apply the *bird_repulsion*. The velocity contribution in this step is the distance between the 2 neighbors boids weighted by *bird_repulsion* and the direction is repulsive for the two boids.

*idx* is a 2 by *m* matrix, where *m* is the number of boids that has at least 1 neighbor invading its privacy. The 2 columns refers to the indexes of the boids that are close to each others.

<div>
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/flocks/02_separation.png" width="400"/>
</div>


```python
def avoidOthers(x0, y0, n, privacy, bird_repulsion):
    dist = squareform(pdist(np.transpose([x0,y0])))
    
    idxmat = (dist<privacy) & (dist !=0)
    idx = np.transpose(np.array(np.where(idxmat)))
    
    vx = np.zeros(n)
    vy = np.zeros(n)
    
    vx[idx[:,0]] = (x0[idx[:,0]] - x0[idx[:,1]])*bird_repulsion
    vy[idx[:,0]] = (y0[idx[:,0]] - y0[idx[:,1]])*bird_repulsion    
    return vx,vy
```

### Rule 3. Alignment
This rule is like the first rule, but for the velocities instead of the positions.
For each boid, we compute the mean velocities of its neighbors, and we return it weighted bu *match_velocity* coefficient.

<div>
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/flocks/03_alignment.png" width="400"/>
</div>


```python
def matchVelocities(x_prev, y_prev, x0, y0, n, neighbors_dist, match_velocity):
    m = squareform(pdist(np.transpose([x_prev,y_prev])))
    idx = (m<=neighbors_dist) # & (m!=0)
    
    vmean_x = np.zeros(n)
    vmean_y = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(0, n-1):
        vmean_x[i] = np.mean( x0[idx[i,]] - x_prev[idx[i,]] )
        vmean_y[i] = np.mean( y0[idx[i,]] - y_prev[idx[i,]] )
    
    return vmean_x*match_velocity, vmean_y*match_velocity
```

## Put all together
In this block the velocities from the 3 rules are add together to update the actual velocity.
The resulting velocity is then restricted to the maximum velocity (otherwise, it happens that they reach  unrealistic velocities and moves like atoms in a very hot gas)

Velocities are also corrected in order to avoid walls. When a boid come closer than *margin* to a wall, a *wall_repulsion* applied opposite to the direction of the wall.


<div>
<img src="/assets/images/flocks/04_wall_repulsion.png" width="400"/>
</div>


```python
def move(x0,y0, x_prev, y_prev, n, neighbors_dist, R, privacy, bird_repulsion, match_velocity, L, margin, wall_repulsion, max_speed):
    
    vx1,vy1 = moveToCenter(x0,y0, neighbors_dist, n, R)
    vx2,vy2 = avoidOthers(x0,y0,  n, privacy, bird_repulsion)
    vx3,vy3 = matchVelocities(x_prev, y_prev, x0,y0,  n, neighbors_dist, match_velocity)

    vx = x0-x_prev + vx1 + vx2 + vx3 
    vy = y0-y_prev + vy1 + vy2 + vy3     
    
    # max speed limit
    # Matrix 2xn. Get the length of the velocity vector for each boid, and 
    # scale it with the maximum value
    v_norm = np.zeros((2,n))
    v_vector = np.array([vx,vy])
    norm = np.linalg.norm(v_vector, axis=0)
    v_norm[:, norm!=0] =  v_vector[:, norm!=0]/norm[norm!=0]*max_speed
    
    vx = v_norm[0,:]
    vy = v_norm[1,:]
    
    # Dump velocity when hits a wall    
    right_border_dist  = L - x0
    left_border_dist   = x0 + L
    upper_border_dist  = L - y0
    bottom_border_dist = y0 + L
    
    vx[right_border_dist < margin] = vx[right_border_dist < margin] - wall_repulsion
    vx[left_border_dist < margin] = vx[left_border_dist < margin] + wall_repulsion
    vy[upper_border_dist < margin] = vy[upper_border_dist < margin] - wall_repulsion
    vy[bottom_border_dist < margin] = vy[bottom_border_dist < margin] + wall_repulsion
    
    x1 = x0 + vx
    y1 = y0 + vy
    
    x1 = np.round(x1)
    y1 = np.round(y1)
    
    return x1,y1
```


```python
for t in range(1,tsteps-1):
    x[:, t+1],y[:, t+1] = move(x[:, t],y[:, t], x[:,t-1],y[:,t-1],
                               n, neighbors_dist, R, privacy, bird_repulsion, match_velocity, 
                               L, margin, wall_repulsion, max_speed)
    
```


```python
def init():
    points.set_data([], [])
    return points,

def animate(i):
    xx = x[:,i]
    yy = y[:,i]
    points.set_data(xx, yy)
    return points,

anim = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, init_func=init,
                                frames=tsteps-2, interval=80, blit=True)
```


```python
from IPython.display import HTML
HTML(anim.to_html5_video())
```

Here you can see the separate contribution of the 3 rules, the final result is a superposition of these 3 effects.
